## Project Overview

Genesis360 combines the best of **Genesis** and **Aeonexus** to offer a feature-rich, **modular superapp** supporting ethical decisions through faith-aligned values, AI-driven insights, and scientific data. Users are empowered to:
- Make personalized healthcare decisions.
- Track and reduce their carbon footprint.
- Engage in advocacy and environmental projects.
- Invest in purpose-driven, socially impactful projects.
- Participate in medical research and contribute to the global data pool.

This project uses **Flutter** for a unified codebase supporting Android and iOS and adopts a modular architecture to ensure seamless expansion.

## Key Features

- **AI-Powered Discernment Engine**: Provides personalized recommendations for healthcare, sustainability, and advocacy.
- **Blockchain Transparency**: Ensures transparency in renewable energy trades, carbon offsets, and impact investments.
- **Sustainability Tracking**: Tracks carbon footprint, energy usage, waste reduction, and circular economy actions.
- **Impact Investment Marketplace**: Connects users with investment opportunities in social impact, renewable energy, and healthcare projects.
- **Crowdsourced Medical Research**: Enables users to contribute anonymized health data to medical research.
- **Gamification and Engagement**: Points, badges, and community challenges to encourage eco-friendly actions and advocacy.

---

## Architecture

The app follows a **modular architecture** using **Flutter** to organize features by domain, enabling:
- Reusability: Components and utilities are shared across modules.
- Scalability: Each feature exists independently, making it easy to add new functionalities.
- Maintainability: Clear separation of business logic, UI, and data handling.

### Core Directories

- **lib/core**: Contains shared functionalities like API clients, utilities, data structures, and global error handling.
- **lib/modules**: Each feature is a module (e.g., healthcare, advocacy, discernment engine), ensuring separation of concerns.
- **lib/shared**: Shared components (UI widgets), themes, and styles for consistent design.
- **lib/test**: Contains unit and integration tests organized by module for thorough test coverage.

## Contributing

### Code Standards
- **Flutter Best Practices**: Follow the [Flutter best practices](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/data-and-backend/json) for coding standards and naming conventions.
- **Modular Structure**: Keep code isolated in modules as per the architecture.
- **Error Handling**: Use `error_handler.dart` for standardized error logging and display.
- **Comments**: Use inline comments to document complex logic or non-standard implementations.

### Branching Strategy
1. **Main Branch**: Stable release code.
2. **Development Branch**: Latest development code (merged only after review).
3. **Feature Branches**: Create feature branches for individual features or bug fixes, e.g., `feature/advocacy-module`.

### Pull Request Process
1. Fork and clone the repository.
2. Create a feature branch.
3. Commit your changes with clear, concise commit messages.
4. Push to your fork and submit a pull request to the development branch.

### Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Write unit tests for new features in `test/unit`.
- **Integration Tests**: Ensure end-to-end functionality with integration tests in `test/integration`.
- **Run Tests**:
  ```bash
  flutter test
  ```
